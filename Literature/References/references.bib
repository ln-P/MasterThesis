We apply an objective, statistical methodology known as Latent Semantic Analysis to decompose each minutes release into its characteristic themes. We show that these themes are correlated with current and future economic conditions. Our evidence suggests that market participants can extract a complex, multifaceted signal from the minutes. In particular, Treasury yield changes around the time of the minutes release depend on the specific themes expressed, the level of monetary policy uncertainty, and the economic outlook.},

abstract = {Using the Panzar and Rosse H-statistic as a measure of competition in 45 countries, we find that more competitive banking systems are less prone to experience a systemic crisis and exhibit increased time to crisis. This result holds even when we control for banking system concentration, which is associated with higher probability of a crisis and shorter time to crisis. Our results indicate that competition and concentration capture different characteristics of banking systems, meaning that concentration is an inappropriate proxy for competition. The findings suggest that policies promoting competition among banks, if well executed, have the potential to improve systemic stability.},

abstract = {The deregulation of financial services in the European Union (EU), together with the establishment of the Economic and Monetary Union, aimed at the creation of a level playing-field in the provision of banking services across the EU. The plan was to remove entry barriers and to foster both competition and efficiency in national banking markets. However, one of the effects of the regulatory changes was to spur a trend towards consolidation, resulting in the recent wave of mergers and acquisitions. To investigate the impact of increased consolidation on the competitive conditions of the EU banking markets, we employ both structural (concentration ratios) and non-structural (Panzar-Rosse statistic) concentration measures. Using bank-level balance sheet data for the major EU banking markets, in a period following the introduction of the Single Banking Licence (1997-2003), this paper also investigates the factors that may influence the competitive conditions. Specifically, we control for differences in efficiency estimates, structural conditions and institutional characteristics. The results seem to suggest that the degree of concentration is not necessarily related to the degree of competition. We also find little evidence that more efficient banking systems are also more competitive. The relationship between competition and efficiency is not a straightforward one: increased competition has forced banks to become more efficient but increased efficiency does not seem to be fostering more competitive EU banking systems.},

This paper presents empirical assessments of the competitiveness in the Canadian banking, trust company, and mortgage company industries, which support the view that parts of Canada's financial system exhibit characteristics of contestability. Since asset concentrations in Canada's financial system do not seem to be decreasing, and since it has long been believed that financial industry concentration impairs competitiveness, making such assessments seems worthwhile. We use a non-structural estimation technique to evaluate the elasticity of total revenues with respect to changes in input prices. The significantly positive values of the elasticity measure indicate that Canada's financial system does not exhibit monopoly power.

abstract = {Prior to the 1990s, it was believed that Central Banks should be in mystery giving away little on the policies they were following. However with time, the importance of transparency and working with, rather than against, markets began to be understood. This has become especially important after central banks began to implement inflation targeting regime and communication strategy has turned out to be a major tool for central banks. In this framework, central banks began to use different communication channels one of which is the monetary policy statements after policy decisions. Our work offers a semantic examination of monetary policy statements from the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (Fed, ECB and CBRT) in order to observe the change in tone of monetary policy statements with movements toward greater transparency. In the study, we examine the monetary policy statements of three central banks in the pre-crisis years of 2002 to the subsequent period of 2015 and compare the specifics of the language used both pre- and post-crisis by making use of Diction 7 software. The results show that optimistic tone of Fed has decreased over the period we studied while certainty tone has increased. As for ECB and CBRT, there is no significant tone difference in certainty, optimism and the realism over time. However, for the CBRT's last two years statements, there is a significant increase of optimistic tone.},

abstract = {This paper reports an empirical assessment of competitive conditions among the major British banks, during a period of major structural change. Specifically, estimates of the Rosse-Panzar H-statistic are reported for a panel of 12 banks for the period 1980-2004. The sample banks correspond closely to the major British banking groups specified by the British Banking Association. The robustness of the results of the Rosse-Panzar methodology is tested by estimating the ratio of Lerner indices obtained from interest rate setting equations. The results confirm the consensus finding that competition in British banking is most accurately characterised by the theoretical model of monopolistic competition. There is evidence that the intensity of competition in the core market for bank lending remained approximately unchanged throughout the 1980s and 1990s. However, competition appears to have become less intense in the non-core (off-balance sheet) business of British banks. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Competition has been regarded as a positive phenomenon for banks; it is perceived that competition makes banks more efficient, stimulates financial innovation and open up new markets. Given the dynamic changes within the Indian banking system in the last two decades, it might be of interest to see whether the developments in the market structure correspond with less competitive behaviour or more on the part of market participants. For empirical assessment of the nature of competitive conditions amongst scheduled Indian commercial banks over a period of 15 years, we use the 'Panzar-Rosser educed form revenue model' to compute the so-called H statistic by estimating the factor price elasticities. It has been argued that if adjustment towards equilibrium is partial and not instantaneous, then static estimates of H statistic will be biased towards zero. Thus in this study alternative estimation techniques have been used for comparing the dynamic H-statistic with static H-statistic. The static H-statistic was found to have a downward bias. However, dynamic as well as static H-statistic, both pointed to the presence of monopolistic competition. The hypotheses of perfect collusion as well as of perfect competition can be rejected using dynamic as well as fixed panel-econometric model estimations using micro data of banks' balance sheets and profit {\&} loss accounts for the years 2000-2014. The division of the entire period into two sub-samples, i.e. before and after 2007 revealed a decrease in competition levels across the two periods. Although, empirical analysis supported the assertion that the nature of competition among the Indian Banks is monopolistic.But it showed a decrease in the level of competitionmay be due to consolidation exercises of top few large banks with smaller banks and also because of the shift from traditional financial business to off-balance sheet activities, which might have lead to the convergence of competitive levels in the second sub-sample period, i.e. after 2007.The second sub-period also corresponds to the global financial 2 crisis of 2008, a possible reason for the lower H-statistic values. The low persistence of profit values (in the sub-periods) should be associated with higher competition, but in the case of the Indian banking sector, it may not be implausible to think that a low persistence of profit may arise from other sources than the only competition. It is also found that the values of competitive conduct (H-statistic), does not coincide with the classical concentration approach (CR5, CR10), for the Indian Banking Industry. The unit cost of funds, capital, and labour were found to be positive and statistically significant. The unit cost of funds was the highest contributor to the overall H statistic. The control variables, such as size and risk were found to be positively affecting the revenue. The findings arrived in this study; highlight the possible links between Indian banking sector competitiveness, profitability, intermediation and regulatory scenario.},

The H-statics obtained from the two methods are 0.54 and 0.51 for the random effect and generalised methods of moments, respectively. The results confirm the presence of a monopolistic competition. On an annual basis, the results show that the Zimbabwean banking sector is evolving towards perfect competition. The increased competition was evident through aggressive promotions, increased marketing of banking products, and increased tenure of loans from one year to three years for individuals as banks tried to outclass each other. The study recommends that the government should desist from tampering with market forces as this reduces the amount of competition .},

Abstract This paper is the first detailed and worldwide investigation of the developments in banking competition during the past fifteen years. Using the Panzar-Rosse approach, we establish significant changes over time in the competitiveness of the banking industry. The changes in competition over time are small on average, but substantial for several countries and regions. Various Western economies faced a significant decline in banking competition during recent years. In particular, the competitive climate in the euro area was subject to a major break around 2001 − 2002, initiating a period of less competition. Also for the United States and Japan we establish a break during this period. The part of Eastern Europe that now belongs to the European Union experienced a significant but modest decrease in competition during the past ten years. Furthermore, the banking industry in emerging markets became more competitive during the last decade. We attribute the predominantly downward trend in competition to increased bank size and the shift from traditional intermediation to off-balance sheet activities.},

abstract = {Many contributions to the literature on competition in banking use the Panzar and Rosse test (1987). This test encompasses a variety of market outcomes assuming firms maximize profits. However, when applied to the banking industry, this assumption may not be always valid as banks sometimes may carry social objectives or aim to be systemic players so as to be “too big to fail.” This then motivates different objective functions, departing from profit maximization. We present a reduced form model where banks can pursue other goals than profit maximization. This allows us to test for behavioral changes of banks over time. Our model provides a framework to evaluate whether moral hazard issues may plague banks receiving state aid, which concerns greatly the recent debate on government intervention in financial markets during the global financial crisis in 2008. To test the impact of state aid, we examine a natural experiment in the banking sector in China in the 1990s. We cannot reject that the possibility of receiving state aid triggers moral hazard prone conduct.},

Using the H statistics, we find that in the crucial pre crisis period, the change in competition has a positive effect on risk (measured by the Z Score), while there is a overall negative effect of the level of competition on risk. The Lerner index provides results supportive of the hypothesis that there are dynamic relations between competition and risk, in that the change in the Lerner index again correlates positively with risk (i.e. narrower margins when competition increases make banks weaker) while the long run effect of heightened competition is also to increase risk. Testing for the reason for differences in long run effects we find that the H and Lerner differ in their impact on the volatility of profits, a key input to the Z Score risk indicator.

In trying to assess the relative competitive position of banking markets in 14 European countries, existing indicators of competition are found to give conflicting predictions across countries, within countries, and over time. This is because indicators of competition tend to measure different things and are additionally influenced by cross-country differences in cost efficiency, fee income levels, real economic growth and inflation. We attempt to separate bank pricing power from these embodied influences and derive more consistent cross-country estimates of banking sector competition. The main result is that our measure of bank pricing power suggests that banking market competition in Europe may well be stronger than implied by traditional measures and analysis. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is a clear trend of increasing concentration at all segments of the Turkish banking sector over the analysed period. The Panzar-Rosse model is used for estimation of competitive conditions in the banking market. Specifically, we use a panel with data for most of the Turkish banks to estimate the H statistics. We concluded that the Turkish banking sector can be characterized as an industry with monopolistic competition that closely approaches monopoly. The results imply that banks in Turkey do not operate in a competitive environment and enjoy monopoly rents. Moreover, we revealed decreasing level of competition during the entire period of estimation. Such a market structure can pose a threat for efficient intermediation of funds through the banking sector and promoting of economic growth.},

To test the competitive conditions, we obtained the H statistic of the Panzar-Rosse model from a revenue function equation. The degree of financial stability is estimated by the Z-score formula. The Chinese banking industry has become an increasingly less concentrated market with an increased number of banks. Along with a decreased market concentration, competition in the Chinese banking industry has improved moderately. However, its market structure is still far from a competitive market. An individual bank's ability to earn higher markup or charge a higher net interest margin contributes to its financial soundness, although a higher degree of market concentration may have negative effect on the financial stability of the entire banking system.},

Furthermore, the paper assesses the impact of the on-going financial crisis (2008-2011) on the competition pattern of the banking sector in the European Monetary Union (EMU) as a whole, where little attention has been paid by the relevant literature. The analysis employs the Panzar and Rosse ((1987). Journal of Industrial Economics, 35, 443) methodology and draws upon a panel dataset of EU banks, spanning the period 1996-2011. The empirical findings are robust, providing updated evidence in favour of a monopolistic competition pattern across all EU economic blocks examined. The level of competition in the EMU countries triggered by bank consolidations seems to have undergone a small, albeit a significant decline, after the adoption of the euro currency and the on-going financial crisis.},

The main conclusion to retain from this study is that banking industry in the region does not seem to have operated either under perfect competition or under perfect monopoly, but rather consistently with long-run monopolistic competition. Further, we also find empirical evidence of efficiency hypothesis posted by Demestz (1973) and Peltzman (1977), as opposed to conventional view that concentration impairs price competitiveness. Finally, we underline the importance of trade off between the costs and benefits of competition to support financial stability objectives. JEL Classification: G21, G28},

abstract = {The present paper uses three different New Empirical Industrial Organization (NEIO) approaches (Panzar-Rosse, Bresnahan-Lau and Hall-Roeger models) to investigate competitive conditions in the Greek banking sector over the period 1995-2004. One important event which has taken place in the Greek banking industry, especially after 1998, is a wave of mergers and acquisitions. This study also measures and compares the degree of banking competition in two sub-periods, 1995-1998 and 1999-2004, in order to investigate the effect of mergers and acquisitions on the competitive structure of Greek banking. The empirical results of the three models indicate a shift from competitive to non-competitive conditions when moving from the first to the second sub-period. This finding suggests that mergers and acquisitions have affected the level of completion of Greek banking, rendering the industry less competitive. Furthermore, taking into consideration the negative effects of mergers and acquisitions on technical efficiency and the total factor productivity of Greek banking (Rezitis, 2008), the empirical findings of the present study provide some indications that one of the outcomes of the Greek banks' merging activities, at least in the short run, might be to attain market power and thus higher profits, rather than higher efficiency and lower costs. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The most famous of them were later successfully adapted to the banking market, are a models of Bresnahan, Panzar-Rosse, Bertrand, Iwat, Monti-Klein-Modesto Barros and others. In Ukraine, the process of assessing the level of competition in the banking sector is very relevant, in line with the recent reforms of particular relevance and distribution. Regarding the domestic deposit market, there is a shortage of qualitative analysis of this issue, unlike foreign practice. Therefore this study we try to solve this problem. The key goal of researchers in this study is in a detailed analysis to identify the important factors which make influence on the allocated markets, in particular on lending and deposit rates. Based on these factors there could be implemented internal adjustment processes taking place in the markets. The purpose of the article is to determine the level of competition in the deposit market of Ukraine in 2006-2015 basing on nonstructural Panzar-Rosse model and identify key factors that affect this level. Methodology. To research the level of competition in the deposit market of Ukraine the Panzar-Rosse model was used, in which separate 11 models were built using the integrated tool "Multiple regression" in the software package of statistics analysis STATISTICA. The input data in the model was presented with the information on financial performance of Ukrainian banks during ten years from 01.01.2005 till 01.01.2015.

Methods/Approach: The paper is examining the market structure using the most frequently applied measures of concentration k-bank concentration ratio (CRk) and Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) as well as evaluating the monopoly power of banks by employing Panzar-Rosse “H-statistic”. Results: The empirical results using CRk and HHI show that Bosnia and Herzegovina banking market has a moderately concentrated market with a concentration decreasing trend. The Panzar-Rosse “H-statistic” suggests that banks in Bosnia and Herzegovina operate under monopoly or monopolistic competition depending on the market segment. Conclusions: Banks operating on the banking market in Bosnia and Herzegovina seem to be earning their total and interest revenues under monopoly or perfectly collusive oligopoly.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Using 481 bank-year observations from an unbalanced panel of 83 banks from six countries over the period 2008-2013. We employed the Panzar-Rosse model of firm competition, and found that the degree of competition among banks in Sub-Saharan Africa increased. This increase is due to the effect of reform/liberalisation policies, largely initiated in the pre-crisis era. The success that followed via the development of banking systems, nonetheless moderated at the onset of the 2007/2008 financial crisis. System instabilities, which were characteristic of a post-crisis period, exposed deficiencies in regulation and asymmetric incentives for bank management. A significant recalibration of prudential policies followed, as regulators sought to restore system stability, which again had an impact in altering competitive conduct of banks. Policymakers should continue to develop and promote policies geared towards the development of financial intermediation and improved competitive conduct of banks in sub-Saharan Africa.},

At the country level, however, we do observe a decline in competition for Brazil, Chile, and Venezuela in late 1990s which may be attributable to increased consolidation. Further, we observe that deregulation and opening up of the financial markets for foreign participation serves as an important catalyst to increase the competitiveness of banking markets. Higher degree of competition in the sector, in return, is associated with reduced bank margins and profitability but improved cost efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Moch2013,
abstract = {Of all of the EU member states, Germany has the largest banking market. However, not all German banking institutions necessarily face fierce competition. Because the industry is highly fragmented, strict separation of the three existing banking pillars may impede competition, with negative effects on financial stability. We assess the competitive stances of 1,888 universal banks from 2001 to 2009 by using the Panzar-Rosse revenue test. We find evidence that measuring competition at an average country level does not necessarily generate valid evaluations of fragmented markets. In addition, we find no clear indication that either the particular objectives of cooperative and savings banks or the legal protection of these institutions impedes competition or discriminates against private banks. Therefore, as long as the relationship between competition and financial stability is dubious, the overall effect and the social costs or benefits of political measures that influence the structure of the German banking market are at least questionable. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the competitive aspects of multi-product banking operations. Extending Panzar and Rosse's (1987) model to the case of a multi-product banking firm, we show that higher economies of scope in multi-product banking are associated with lower Panzar-Rosse measures of competition in the banking sector. To test this empirical implication and determine the impact of multi-production on market power, we use a new dataset on the Brazilian banking industry. Consistent with our theoretical prediction, we find that banks that offer classic banking products (i.e., loans and credit cards) and other banking products (i.e., brokerage services, insurance and capitalization bonds) have substantially higher market power than banks that offer only classic products. These results suggest a positive bias in the traditional estimates of competition in which multi-output actions are not considered.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to assess the level of competition prevailing in the Spanish banking system. The current analysis employs a widely used non-structural methodology put forward by Panzar and Rosse (1987) - the so-called H-statistic - and draws upon a comprehensive panel dataset of Spanish commercial and savings banks covering the period 1986-2005. Standard estimates characterize a hump-shaped profile for the H-statistic throughout the time span under consideration. Nevertheless, a weighted procedure is subsequently performed in order to control for firm size and the number of branches. The estimation outcome reveals a gradual rising path for the H-statistic, thus suggesting a more competitive environment among larger banks. In both settings, a noteworthy increase in the degree of competition is identified at the turn of the eighties, when several liberalization-oriented policy measures came into force. The aforementioned findings discredit the widespread hypothesis which states that concentration impairs competition.},

@article{Harvey2017,
abstract = {Given the competition for top journal space, there is an incentive to produce “significant” results. With the combination of unreported tests, lack of adjustment for multiple tests, and direct and indirect p-hacking, many of the results being published will fail to hold up in the future. In addition, there are basic issues with the interpretation of statistical significance. Increasing thresholds may be necessary, but still may not be sufficient: if the effect being studied is rare, even t {\textgreater} 3 will produce a large number of false positives. Here I explore the meaning and limitations of a p-value. I offer a simple alternative (the minimum Bayes factor). I present guidelines for a robust, transparent research culture in financial economics. Finally, I offer some thoughts on the importance of risk taking (from the perspective of authors and editors) to advance our field.

Second, although the level of market competition remains low throughout Japanese local cities, it is competitive compared with the metropolitan area of Korea.

We also propose a dynamic reformulation of these models within a panel data context, in order to address possible statistical problems associated with the dynamic nature of bank-level data. The results suggest that both static methods provide lower estimates of market power relative to their dynamic counterparts. Therefore, the inclusion of some dynamics in the models, even though it increased estimation complexity, helped to reveal some collusive behavior of banks.},

The estimated H-statistics are positive ranging from 0.53 to 0.81 and the Wald test for the market structure for monopoly or perfect competition is rejected. The results imply that the financial institutions in Malaysia earned their revenue in the condition of monopolistic competition with the traditional interest-based market is significantly less competitive than the overall market. The evidence is however insufficient to show that there is an increase in competition due to a change in the market structure. Thus, the findings suggest that additional competition policy is needed to ensure competition in the Malaysian banking market in view of further consolidation in the banking sector.},
