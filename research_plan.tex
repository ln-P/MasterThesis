   \noindent The following document is an outline and notebook concerning a review study that aims to quantify between group differences in competition studies written by two groups of economists: Central Bank  vs. University.
\end{abstract}
\end{minipage}

\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection*{Rationale}
Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.\\

\newline \noindent
\textit{Hypothesis:} Central Bank Researchers face higher \textbf{reputation risk}, compared to university researchers, when publishing studies about market power abuse. Economists employed by central banks are placed under \textbf{higher public scrutiny}, hence their publications can have stronger \textbf{signalling effect}.

\subsection*{Objective}
We aim to quantify if there are significant, measurable differences in competition papers published by two groups of researchers. \\

\newline \noindent
Possible \textit{"sources"} of heterogeneity :
\begin{enumerate}
    \item When looking at the same market, using the same \textit{(similar?)} methodology  two groups get either contrary or close but \textbf{different} (insignificant, smaller confidence, higher variability) outcomes.
    \item Looking at the two groups we find significant semantic differences. As a result, we would be able to classify paper to either group based on the words they use.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item First idea: Latent Semantic Analysis to find proximity between different papers.
            \item I purchased Natural Language Processing book, so further ideas to come.
        \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Meta-Study:}
Generally accepted structure required for the meta-study.

\subsection*{Save study protocol before actual study}

The \textit{before} protocol \textbf{has to include}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Problem statement
    \item Literature search strategy
    \item Exclusion/inclusion criteria
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Literature search strategy}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Which databases
    \item Key words/definition of the search strategy
    \item Publication restrictions (e.g. language)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Eligibility criteria}
Decide which of the collected papers to include/exclude. \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item Clear distinction between central bank and who university economist.
\end{itemize}

\newline \noindent
After the selection process is done create PRISMA Flow diagram to summarise the articles exclusion/inclusion process.

\subsection*{Calculate the size effects}
\textbf{Def.} Effect size is usually a standardised measure of the magnitude of observed effect (Clark-Carter, 2003; Field, 2005c).

\subsection*{Do the basic meta-analysis}
Estimate effects in the population by combining
the effect sizes from a variety of articles. The estimate is a weighted mean of the effect sizes. \\

\newline \noindent
Here ideal outcome would be to find clear \textbf{heterogeneity} in the effect sizes between two groups.



\section{Language Processing / Semantic Analysis}
The initial idea is to run Latent Semantic Analysis and by looking at word frequency in each document try to classify papers based on their comparability/similarity between each other.

\section{Problems}

\subsection*{The Effect size}

According to Stanley et al. in \textit{“Reporting Guidelines for Meta-Regression Analyses in Economics”}, in order to conduct successful meta-study:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A precise definition of how effects are measured (the ‘effect size’), accompanied by any relevant formulas.
    \item An explicit description about how measured effects are comparable, including any methods used to standardise or convert them to a common metric.
\end{itemize}

\newline \noindent
As I already pointed out we face significant difficulty when it comes to the second point. Also we cannot just look at the sign and/or significance since the main purpose of the meta-study is to aggregate multiple papers to average out the bias that might come from single study and therefore find the \textit{"true" outcome}.   \\

\newline \noindent
However, maybe we could use \textbf{Cohen’s d}: $\frac{\mu_1 - \mu_2}{\sigma}$, where two means would be papers classified to central bank or university and the variance can be a pooled estimate based on both groups individual size and variances (for me it looks very similar to pooled t-static for unequal variances). We would have to do the comparison for individual models separately. \\

\newline \noindent
Although, just looking at Panzar-Rosse I can see problem since different papers use \textbf{different estimation methods}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Revenue equation: $log(TR)$ with $log(TA)$ as a control variable
    \item $log(TR/TA)$  without $log(TA)$ as a control variable
    \item Price equation: $log(TR/TA)$ with $log(TA)$ as a control variable
\end{enumerate}
